I developed a simple linear regression model to predict salaries based on years of experience. The model uses historical data to establish a relationship between an individualâ€™s work experience and their corresponding salary. By analyzing this data, the model fits a linear equation that can be used to make accurate salary predictions for different experience levels. The goal was to explore how salary increases with experience and provide a tool that estimates future salaries for professionals based on their experience in the field. The model was trained and tested to ensure its predictive accuracy and reliability.
